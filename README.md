# Branch Descendant

This action checks that a branch's nearest MST ancestor is the Master branch. If the nearest MST ancestor is master, then the action will succeed, otherwise it will fail. In either case the action returns the outputs listed below. Read more about MST here: https://github.com/colpal/MST-branching

## Inputs

### None

## Outputs

### `valid`

#### Valid MST
A boolean indicating whether or not the closest MST ancestor branch is the Master branch. Either `true` or `false`.

### `PR-string`

#### Pretty String for PRs

A pretty string indicating whether or not the closest MST ancestor branch is the Master branch. Either `"Master branch is closest MST parent. PR good to go üëç"` or `"Master branch should be the closest MST parent. PR not good to go üëé"`

### `closest-MST-parent`

#### Closest MST Ancestor

A string indicating which MST branch is the closest ancestor to the branch being considered. Either `"Master"`, `"Develop"`, or `"Test"`.

## Example usage

The following example runs the action on every pull request to the develop, test, or master branches. It then prints out the three outputs in the action, and leaves a comment containing the three outputs on the PR. Note that `continue-on-error` is set to `true` for this action. If this is not set, the action will fail when the nearest MST ancestor branch is not master, which will cause the action to fail. This may or may not be desirable depending on your use case.
